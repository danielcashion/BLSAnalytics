# Welcome to the BLS repo!!

This repo was created because I found no production quality code to retrieve, analyze and utilize BLS data.

There were a few Jupyter Notebooks that `read_csv` files (static and should never be used in a production environment) and created a simple chart. Told me nothing. Does nothing beyond a homework project for a data analysis or data science class.

## APIs, GITHUB Secrets, etc.

I have interviewed many people over my life. Passwords and private credentials are all over developers' code. If you think that your org is secure, I would run a scan for 'pwd' or 'token' in your production/development repos. You will likely be shocked.
